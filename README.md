# ComputerVision391A

Course repo for **Computer Vision (391A)**. This repository contains my assignments, experiments, and small utilities for topics like image formation, geometric transforms, sampling/quantization, and noise analysis.

## How this repo is organized

- Each assignment lives in its **own folder** and includes a **local `README.md`** with instructions, dependencies, and usage for that assignment.
- The root README (this file) gives the high-level map of the repo.
